<b>[Sculpting a God]</b>
- By Rudeus Greyrat

<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
It is said that a certain sculptor used to recite sutras before setting out to sculpt an idol. 
Emulating him, turn towards the direction God lives in and offer your prayers. Then place the rock you are going to chisel towards the sun, assume your most pious posture and express gratitude in your heart. 
God is certainly not an existence that grants everything you want. But It’s an existence that shows the way forward in our life. We shouldn’t forget our respect and affection for the God. 
After reminiscing on the God's appearance and carving it into your heart deeply, visualize it on your carving stone. The thing you are set to do now is divine work. Perform it with a pious heart.

<b><u>Preparations</u></b>
Chisel the stone and separate it into a few parts. Head, chest, stomach, waist, upper arms, lower arms, hands, thighs, shins, and feet. We create the God's form by carefully making each part and joining them together.

<b><u>Torso, Stomach, and Waist</u></b>
Only an amateur would start from the God’s countenance. The torso is the first thing we should be creating. It’s desirable to start from the God’s chest while keeping the God's appearance in your mind. God’s chest that holds the humble yet plentiful breasts. Even if it’s charming, you shouldn’t sink into depraved thoughts because they dirty the exalted nature of the God.
In addition, a mole is an extremely noble and appreciated thing. Please place them without even forgetting a single one. 
The stomach should be gently sloping, and smooth. The important one is the belly button and the folds circling it. It’s possible to bring out the softness even if the material is stone, so please chisel it meticulously.
When it comes to the waist, it’s about the hips.  And as hips include the so-called secret place, anyone who exposes it would surely be struck down by divine punishment. Let’s cover this part with the much appreciated divine sacrament. 

<b><u>Arms and Legs</u></b>
Next, carve out the legs and arms. Anyhow, God is not really a muscled figure. The arms and legs are more similar to sticks, with just a hint of immaturity. It’s desirable to sculpt the limbs true to reality.

<b><u>Joining the Parts</u></b>
After all the parts are completed, proceed to join them with magic. If you had any wicked thoughts at this stage, God’s unadorned body turns into something with too much charm. If a misguided fellow sees that, he would be enveloped by depraved thoughts instead of exaltation towards the God.
At that time, think about the things lacking and are required in this God. Please think about what’s needed to show the God’s majesty instead of stirring up wicked thoughts. You will likely find the answer in a moment.
It’s the cool factor. Hiding her chest with one hand, and with another wide extended out. You can express her coolness by making her hold the ceremonial object, the staff, with the extended hand. 
With this God’s body is completed.

<b><u>Attire</u></b>
To keep the God unadorned is proof of impiety. God should be clothed.
Instead of creating it from God’s form as it is now, it’s preferred to make a loose robe as it brings out more of her divinity this way. The arm hiding the would be a problem if you tried to clothe the God, but it’s possible to cover with the robe’s bagginess.
Now, please attach an arm to the clothes. It will look more natural holding the staff than before even while hiding another arm under the clothes. Furthermore, by making these clothes undressable you can show two sides of the God. 

<b><u>The Countenance</u></b>
And finally, the face. But take a look at God’s body once more before you set out to carve the face. 
When God’s wearing clothes and leaning a bit forward holding her staff, it feels as if she looks just as gallant as the Goddess of war Athena, doesn’t she? 
And the undressed God, slightly leaning forward trying to hide her chest while being embarrassed, is giving off the charm of a young maiden, doesn’t she?
Taking this into account, it’s surely desirable to think up of a countenance that is suitable for both expressions. The expression that’s made by equal parts of coolness and embarrassment. 
You would likely be able to many faces of the God with such expression if you close your eyes and reminisce on the God.
And like that please continue to remake it, slowly nearing the ideal form, till it is to your liking.

<b><u>Completion</u></b>
Finally, by attaching the face to the body, it’s completed. 


Let’s make it together, Roxy figurine!
