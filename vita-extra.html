<h1>Vita extra - LN 24</h1>
<div class="main">
	From vol 24 Vita's extra -
<div class="card">
>slimes are formerly just magic beasts
>they are parasites that hides in fruit and dead animals and lives off whoever eats them
>then someone made one intelligent by experimenting on it. After throwing it out at the end it went back to its race and made them intelligent
>their healing abilities are racial and they are used so as supplements for main warriors during great human-demon wars
</div>
In the universal library arc that is LN exclusive, there's a slime there that concurrently writes every book being written anywhere in the world. Seems like it was the slime given magic eye by kishirika in exchange for service by the slime race.
<div class="card">
>vita is a fucking miko but he doesn't know it himself
>he nearly died when he jumped into a river not knowing what it is while he was fucking around as a child
>hitogami saved him from a fish's stomach, gave him a way to get his slime back and informed him his true abilities
>and like that moving up the stomachs of food chain, he managed to get eaten by an important demon king in the laplace war and controls him. All by hitogami's advice btw
>death god laxus is this king's underling. He nearly kills vita and kicks him out of the king when he comes back after a journey
>he follows vita killing his host everytime. Also kills the inventor of a slime finding magic tool, and uses the tool to exterminate vita's hometown along the way
>vita pisses himself but bets everything on his dream ability
>tries to approach laxus through his friend but gets done in by the ring
>the faggot friend lets him away because he got to see his girlfriend or something
>vita decides he is fucked and runs away to hide in hell dungeon with hitogami's help. He again moves through the dungeon's food chain, gets eaten by guardian
>while he passes time in the dungeon, reflecting on his actions, our lovely god laughs at him saying he is the only one left of slimes and they all died because of him (Which you know, is a complete lie)
>after a long time, hitogami does the same routine he did with badi
>geese arrives with badi after a while (likely the first ones to clear the hell dungeon) and takes vita in a bottle
>he asks vita not to kill superds whatever may happen because ruijerd is his benefactor
>vita remembers his anguish over his race's destruction and thinks he should cure them if it doesn't affect their plan
>Ends with a line saying he understimated laxus's persistence.

It is probably implying that vita did cure superd's disease but his allahu akbar caused a different set of problems. And soukas tea solved it not because of its mana ejecting properties but due it's diarrohea causing nature.
