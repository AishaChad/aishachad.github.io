**************************************************************************************************************

Founding of Orsted Corporation 8th anniversary party

The ‘Party’ is conducted in the office basement. A room in the basement is dimly lit by the candle light. And the candles giving off this light are stuck in a big cake.
The one sitting right in front of that cake is the man with the scariest face in this world; Orsted. Though his expression is not visible right now, what with his face being covered by the mask and stuff.
Asura Area’s branch manager Ariel. Dolls department’s advertising head Zanoba. Anti curse division head Cliff, Rudo mercenary group leader Linia and vice leader Pursena. Advisor Aisha is in maid outfit today and standing before the cart carrying the cake.
Even though the gloomy room is lightly decorated and feels just like what a birthday party should be like, everyone has a tense look on their faces. What is this ritual? What the heck would they be made to do? What did they do this time? With eyes muddled with fear and unease they snuck glances at Orsted and me.
Even Ariel and Zanoba can’t hide their cold sweat. 
This is odd. Maybe Orsted’s mask is not working…
“......”
I feel like even Orsted’s making a “<i>I am going to kill you now</i>” type of befuddled face right now. As I thought, I have to be the one to proceed the meeting, being the one that curse doesn’t affect and all.
“Ariel-sama. Haven’t you mentioned before that you would like an opportunity to show your loyalty to Orsted sama?”
Immediately, Ariel trembled a bit and everyone’s gaze locked on her. <i>What the heck did this woman do?</i>, the looks converging on her seemed to say.
“<i>Ariel bungled up. A chance for promotion!</i>” seems to be what ambitious ones like Linia are thinking, a bit of gloat coloring their smiles. If this is a manga, in the next scene Linia would be facing judgement after Ariel is dealt with. Something like <i>By the way Linia, didn’t you steal Orsted sama’s snacks that time?</i>

Anyhow back to Ariel.
“I-I certainly did, but this…”
“Well then, please”
“Y-yes”
Ariel stepped before Orsted nervously. Her shoulders are trembling with little shivers, hands clenched tightly near her stomach. But for some reason there’s not much unease showing through her face. Rather it looks like she is having fun; or maybe more like rapture. A bit scary but maybe this is the expression suitable for someone who mowed down the sly old nobles by the handful as the Queen of Asura kingdom.
“Orsted sama seems to be in good spirits. All of us present here, in this place, will once more present our oath of loyalty to you. I pray that you will be in good health until the day you defeat hitogami”
Saying that, Ariel bowed her head. While as a great country’s queen it would not do to bow her head lightly, she seems to be showing that she has no intention of forgetting who made her queen in the first place.
“....aah”
After nodding to Ariel’s words, Orsted turned to look at me. I feel like he is making a face asking what the hell is this, under that mask.
“Rudeus, what the hell is this?”
See, bingo! Anyhow, I too do not intend to make this get-together too formal.

“It is the party for the 8th anniversary of Orsted corporation’s founding”

<i>What is that even</i>, seems to be the mood in the air but….
“Anyhow, congratulations. For we are gathering together like this and cooperating with each other towards a single goal! Today, let’s ascertain our determination to work towards defeating hitogami and strengthen our unity even more! Following Ariel sama’s proposal for such a meeting, I arranged a get-together like this”
The atmosphere seemed to soften when I said that. What, that’s all it is? Seems to be the thought going through everyone’s head.
“Well then Orsted sama, please blow out the candles on the cake”
“....aah”
The candles went out in no time the moment Orsted turned towards the cake. Did he blow them out? Seems like I have missed it. Ah, well.
“Well, claps everyone”
Everyone clapped with a weird look on their faces.
“Orsted sama is scary but strangely his fearsomeness weakens when Master does nonsensical stuff like this”
Zanoba said uncalled for things there at the end, but well let’s just disregard them.

After that the party went on without a hitch and we deepened our amity. Though the mood’s a bit strange during the party, I was thanked by Ariel before she left. As this meeting’s organised on her proposal, you can say it’s the most satisfactory conclusion for me as long as Ariel is satisfied. 
Incidentally on talking to sylphy about this she made a grim face saying “That thanks, it’s probably for something else…”. I feel like I got a little glimpse into the abyss of Asura’s royalty, but that’s a different story.
