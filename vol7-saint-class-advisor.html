[Ex-soldier Rudeus Greyrat decided to go do farming in Kansas state and start his life over. While he did decide to start a new life, he doesn’t have the know-how for farming. 

He starts his battle against the PTSD that kicks in just by starting the combine and the eternal onslaught of pests and weeds. The one who appeared in the middle of this fight is the agricultural advisor Roxy Migurdia. In a blink of an eye, she taught Rudeus farming, and the graduation day is here]
</i></b>
“Hats off, Rudy…... you pass”

Roxy said while swaying her voluptuous breasts, looking at the grain field stretching to the horizon. That entire thing that spreads before her eyes is nothing but wheat, the golden-brown cash I grew from nothing. 

You can see the ears of the wheat drooping heavily with grain even from afar. It is an admirable piece of farming.

“Eh? But you haven’t looked at the other fields yet!”

When I said that, Roxy shrugged with a forced expression. 

“There’s no need. The other fields also look like this right? If we are just going to look at it, it’s better to use that time to harvest”

“Aa, ok”

I turned on the automatic combine’s engine and started harvesting. This second-hand combine I bought on Roxy’s advice is just about efficient enough but it’s easy to use and it’s now familiar to me as my own limbs. It took just a short time to complete the harvest.

Even so, Roxy and I were drenched in sweat by the time it’s over. 

“Congratulations. With this, you too are a splendid farmer now.”

The gorgeous woman proclaimed while drenched in sweat, pulling back her damp hair strands and placed a kiss on my cheek. In that moment, I felt an odd feeling stirring in my stomach. I know this feeling.

The feeling of accomplishing something.

The feeling I felt in Vietnam whenever we comrades hugged each other like mad after an operation’s success. For the first time since starting farming, I truly felt I took a step forward.

The next day, I cried at leaving Roxy who said she had nothing else to teach me. I truly learned a lot of things from her. Knowledge, experience, and skills. If she wasn’t there, I would have been probably still fighting with my PTSD.

Really, more than all she cured my PTSD. I drove the combine. That’s all it took. But I no longer fear the sound of an engine’s revving. She did something my wife or daughter, my friends from the war, or the military doctors weren’t able to do. 

Let’s respect her. That glamorous and sexy golden-haired blonde, let’s respect her. 

I promised so to myself in my heart while looking at Roxy’s figure becoming smaller by the minute in the distance.
