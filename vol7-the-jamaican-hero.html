<b><i>[I am Rudeus Greyrat, a tough and cool-looking nice guy. I am employed as a home tutor for a lady from a good family after I retired from service with PTSD but this lady is still a wild horse.
I somehow got this wild horse under control and made it learn something, but while sailing on a luxury cruise, a big disaster. Naturally, it’s a shipwreck.
The tough me thought I at least have to save the lady and after swimming across the sea, an unfamiliar land. According to that fucking god who started appearing in my dreams since the VietCong time, seems like this is South America.]</i></b>

When I opened my eyes, there’s a man sitting in front me. I rose immediately, walked over the campfire and put a gun to his temple.

“Who are you! Do you intend to use as sacrifices for your god, do you!”
“Hey, hey, hey! Calm down!”
“What did you do to us!”
“I saved you! Did schools in your country teach you gift a bullet to people who saved you!?”

Hearing that he saved us, I took my gun away even while doubting a bit. The god in my head mostly tells correct things. But there are also times when he says boring jokes while shrugging his shoulders. I have to keep it in mind. 

Emerald green hair, a red jewelled nose pierce, a vertically cutting scar on face, and obsidian black skin. And to round it off, the iconic duo of a radio-cassette player and a amaracs beside him. The different races taught by trainer Roxy during my time at military school floated up in my mind.
It’s a jamaican.

“What happened...”
“You people were collapsed in that beach over there, and I passed by, and dragged you up and made this fire to dry you. Meaning I saved you, very simple right?”

I see, it’s really simple. And when I am thinking that, Lady Eris opened her eyes. She was surprised at seeing the Jamaican first, but in the end it’s just a Jamaican. It’s not like he is the evil monster she was told in her childhood, so she interacted with a calm head.

“......I am Eris, and this is Rudeus. Nice to meet you”
“Oy oy, isn’t this a better manners than the old man getting on in his years!”
“Please give your name too”
“Okay, I am Ruijerd. A travelling musician. I make new songs while roaming around south america like this.”

Seems like this man is named Ruijerd. I thought he would named with something like a D or a J, seems like that isn’t the case. 

“Ok, I like the cut of your jib, lady, I will get you back to your hometown. On my beloved car, of course”

When Eris informed him about the situation, he pointed his thumb towards his back. There’s an italian car with a dully gleaming trident mark in the direction he is pointing at. A fairly antique one at that.

“Is it fine?”
“Yes, but don’t complain about the music in car. That’s my soul”
“Of course”

While I am thinking things over, the conversation proceeded at it’s own pace and Eris got into the car with a victorious expression. Well, it can’t be helped if it turned out like this. Let’s just think about protecting Eris and getting her back home. 


“By the way, where are we now exactly?”
“This is Ushuaia, southernmost point of the continet”
“As, seems like our bad luck’s still going on”
Thus, we set out on crossing south america on the guy’s car.
