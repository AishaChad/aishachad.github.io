On a certain holiday. The afternoon of a clear day drenched with pleasantly warm sun rays. Eris wandered about the manor after she completed her self-training, wondering how to pass the noon. Should she set out for the town with Ghislaine even if it’s already afternoon? Or else should she go to her grandfather and get doted on? Father and mother are probably busy but maybe it’s good to ask them to play with her sometimes? While Eris was pondering over her choices a certain person appeared in her view, laid across a bench in the garden.  From the book resting on his chest, it seems like he was reading it outdoors. 

“Such bad manners, Rudeus”

While saying that Eris approached him with silent footsteps. Rudeus has his eyes closed and lets out a steady breath like he is sleeping. 

“..............”

Eris, feeling restless without knowing why, took a close look at Rudeus’s sleeping face. It’s a rare thing to see him dozing off as Rudeus doesn’t tend to show any gaps normally. Philip said it’s him trying to be strong because he is in a place away from his family, but…

“......nfufufu”

Her teasing heart started to become restless. To think that Rudeus can make this kind of sleepy face. Rudeus disturbs her afternoon sleep a lot. He makes her suffer in different ways like shaking her, tickling her chest or underarms, and sometimes he even rolls her skirt up and slips her panties down. 

(It’s time for revenge!)

Eris smiles broadly and draws close to him. Rudeus continues to sleep peacefully like he is having a good time. Even though her heart skipped a beat at his cherubic face, Eris doesn’t plan to show any mercy.

She quickly got her hands on his belt and took it off without making a sound and released the hook holding the pants. When she did that, a plain-looking underwear peeked out a bit from the edges of the pants.

“...gulp”

For some reason, Eris took a gulp on seeing that. She felt like she was doing something she should not be doing at all. Despite this being her way of taking revenge… 

But Eris won’t stop. 

(I-it’s Rudeus’s fault)

She put her hands on Rudeus’s pants, her heartbeat ringing out like bells. Carefully, trying to not wake him up, she continued to drag them down slowly. Under it is Rudeus’s lower half, with fairly muscled thighs and hips wrapped in white underwear. Eris’s gaze is directed towards its center, gravitating towards the part that’s slightly rising a bit. That’s a part Eris does not have.

“Gulp….”

Eris slowly, very slowly laid her hands on the underwear. The moment she tried to carefully pull them down. Suddenly, a face raises and meets a pair of wide-open eyes. The eyes of Eris and Rudeus who raised his upper half. 

“Ah, eeh, what----BUAH!”

Rudeus didn’t manage to get the full sentence out before Eris’s sudden fist met his jaw on point and knocked him out cold. Rudeus’s eyes rolled back into his head and he returned to his previous state. 

“.....That was a close call”

Eris wiped out the cold sweat from her forehead that appeared at some point and stealthily returned his underwear to how it was. Getting the pants back on…. she stopped and took a look around. Confirming there’s no one around, she put a finger under the underwear’s edge and had a quick peek inside. 

“.....fu, fnn!”

With her breath wild, she adjusted the underwear, got the pants back on, closed the hook, and returned the belt. And blushing furiously she quickly walked away.

For a while after that Eris blushed furiously whenever she saw Rudeus and raised her fist alarmingly. But Rudeus having lost his consciousness before he made head or tails of the situation and thus not having a scrap of memory of the event, can only continue to lean his head in wonder and run away.
