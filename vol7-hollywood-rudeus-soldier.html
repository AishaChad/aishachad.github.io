I am Rudeus Greyrat. 
Presently an umarried former soldier, and a mature, nice guy in the middle of regretting my life. 

3 hours before, I am just a former soldier. But as it happened, one day out of nowhere there are divorce papers on my table. Later, I fought with my wife for my daughter’s custody, but I easily lost and thus became alone.

There are no allies for me who stayed at home all day with my wartime PTSD as an excuse and was violent with my family. Even my sister Jane, who is a lawyer, allied with my wife. And the meat factory I worked at dared to kick me out the moment the court gave its verdict.

I exploded with half-madness and cried unseemingly at the last minute, but at the end most of my pay from the service got plundered for the settlement  and I was left with a pitiful amount of cash and the house.

Although, I already spent that little cash on drink already…..

“........”

I am swaggering around the town with a bottle in my hand at the moment. My ears are still ringing with the words my wife said when she left the house.

“It can finally get some peace now”

I feel queasy remembering it. Who the hell do you think protected this country’s peace! 

“Damn it!”

When I threw the bottle cursing, an ugly-looking cat scuttered into a back ally and a kid with a skateboard stood wincing at me. He disappeared in a moment, but my head cooled down after seeing the kid.

“Haa….”

What should I do now…..no, know it in my mind. There’s no money left, so I should be searching for a job first. But how?

Of course by visiting the employment security office. I have skills. As far as driving is concerned I can handle cars, tanks, helicopter,s and even aeroplanes. I am good with a gun and explosives are in fact my specialty.

Only if it’s not for my PTSD. I am a piece of junk now who becomes useless at the sound of an engine or a small explosion. The reason I am dropped by the meat processing factory is probably because I start shaking at just hearing a delivery truck.

“..............haa”

I am at a loss. At this point, I realized my life’s at a complete dead end. 

“Tch, seems like even the god abandoned me”

Furthermore, it started to rain. The summer already ended and it’s about the time when it starts getting cold. The rain soaked the tanktop already threadbare from years of use and started chilling me to the bone without mercy.

“.....If I can start over”

With those words unintentionally flowing out, I looked at the sky raining cats and dogs. There’s nothing to look at there except the coal tar sky.

“Nn?”

And the moment I thought that I suddenly noticed something in the corner of my sight.

“Giving you a second life”

It’s a billboard advertising for those who want to free themselves from their white-collar jobs and manage farms in the sticks. The moment I saw the board, my second life began.
