[Sylphiette is one of the street children that live in the slums of Kansas City. While searching through the garbage heap to find anything to sell like usual, she accidentally saw a group of hoodlums killing a police officer. She is then chased after by those people, having seen the face of the culprits.
The one who appeared in front of Sylphy while she is trying to escape is Rudeus Greyrat, who is trying to finalize a contract to sell the wheat.  Rudeus took down those hoodlums in the blink of an eye and saved the girl]

I aimed and threw apples in my hand at red shirts chasing the boy. The apples stuck the back of their heads splendidly and drenched the black suits with juices. The black suits started to run away with multiple “fucks” thrown around, leaving the boy alone.

“Hey, tell me, Why did you save me?”

The boy seems to be a street urchin, all skin and bones. He looks as if though he is an elf out of a fairy tale. When I thought that, I even feel like his ears are a little pointy too. But unfortunately, unlike the pristine elves, this one’s a little dirty.

“That’s because I was taught to be an ally for the weak in the school. Well, the school’s for teaching tactics to marines, although”

“But won’t the people from before try to take revenge?”

They probably would won’t they? But that’s only if they are members of a proper mafia gang. If they are the kind that colludes with the police, my life would be in danger.

“It’s fine. They killed a police officer. So, they will probably get taken revenge on by the state run gangs first”

Of course, it’s not like I thought that far ahead before acting. If my brain’s that good I would not have let my daughter and wife leave me. When I started walking with those thoughts in my mind, the young boy followed me.

“What is it? Don’t follow me”
“They could kill me before they are caught by the police….”
“Maybe”
“Hey, give me shelter, even for a short time is fine”

What an audacious brat. I stretched my neck out on my own initiative but I can’t take more trouble on.

“Hey, please, I am relying on you….”

But when I see this boy I am reminded of my estranged daughter’s face. Despite being not looking the same at all…

 “Okay, okay!”
“Really!?”
“But you will have to help with my work in exchange for the shelter. It’s farming! It’s going to be as hard as marine training, you know!”
“Understood! I will do it!”

When I said that, the boy’s face lit up. As I thought, a child’s smile is a good thing. Knowing that, why did I even those things to my family………..shit.

“Reminds me, I haven’t got your name. I am Rudeus”
“Syl….phy...”
“Isn’t that a nice name. Like the spirit of the winds”

When I said that Sylphy blushed and nodded with a quiet “un”
