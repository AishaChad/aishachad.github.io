>just the tip!! Only just the tip, ok, ok (pun. It's about giving him directions for what to do just right after, doesn't translate nicely)
</div>
Yea though let’s explain the neta cause it’s funny and amusing. I’ll help out:

Let’s say you want to have sex and you’re refused, or say you want to do it raw without condoms but it doesn’t feel like the woman would permit it, you use “just the tip ok? Just the tip I swear”
It’s basically used as an excuse/chance to make someone agree with you or in this case to have sex because obviously once you have the tip of your penis inside the vagina the rest is easy and you can just fuck.
This neta got really popular after a certain comedy show on TV popularized it.

Which is how Rudeus’s uses it as a retort to Hitogami’s advice as he was still getting adviced in the end didn’t regardless of “just the tip” or 先っぽだけ if anons get my gist
