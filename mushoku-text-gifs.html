	I went to the floating citadel with eris today. Eris as usual likes the view here. I was a little afraid, but as I finally got the chance, I did the flying imitation thing that was famous in my former world, and Eris felt very happy. Plan is a success. But it's weird...... I don't remember what happened after that. Why is it so...

	Today too, Lucy got to ride on Orsted's shoulders and is in a happy mood. She made a an ahoge and played with all her heart today. I looked at them with a smile until she started crooning "papa, papa" to herself. Damn you (to Orsted)!
	Maybe it's just me, but I felt like Orsted was making a smug face. Damn it! Papa will cry you know!

	Ars and Sieg became taller and with the training by  Eris, I think they are growing strong. But they are children still. Let's have a warm interaction between the father and the sons today.
	That is, a hand wrestling match. Fufufu, while showing the father's greatness, eventually losing on purpose... i-it's on purpose, certainly!
	....Let's make it a magic competition next time, mm.
