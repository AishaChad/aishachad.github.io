Right in the middle of the Holy Sword highway. Roxy is sitting there demurely, while Elinalise and Talhand watch over her from the thickets a distance away. 

“Haa….”

In front of the sighing Roxy, there’s a pure white horse with a long horn. 

A unicorn. 

With a pure white body, spiraling horn, and a mane like a lion, this horse is the one-horned existence of the legends from the Rudeuss original world. Said to be extremely violent, be it a lion or an elephant, this is a violent horse that rushes them head-on and impales them with its horn. 

But for some reason, it becomes calm when held on a pure maiden’s lap, and so is considered to be a symbol of purity and an addict to virgins. Unicorns of this world also have the same characteristics. 

If there is one thing that can be said to be different, it’s that this world treats them as one of the multitudes of demonic beasts that are commonplace. While they are treated as a bit special by the residents of the Great Forest from their nature of only relaxing their guard for maidens, that’s all there is. 

“See, It came! As we thought, Roxy’s really still inexperienced!”

As Elinalise said, Unicorn appeared from the surrounding foliage and slowly approached Roxy. The three of them discovered the unicorn on the roadside by accident, and are trying to lure it out using Roxy. 

“Oi, don’t you go before it”
“I know….”

Unicorn moved beside Roxy without paying any attention to Elinalise. Then bowing its head so deep like it’s trying to bury its nose into its knees, it knelt. Roxy accepted the gesture with an expression like the Holy Mother and caressed the unicorn’s head.

That scenery is truly something out of a fantasy. If Rudeus is here, he would probably shed tears at the overflowing divinity, take a knee and give prayers to the god.

With a countenance overflowing with affection, she continued to brush the unicorn’s head gently, slowly moving to its neck…. And grabbed the mane suddenly.

“HiHiiiin!”

The unicorn tried to stand, surprised at being grabbed strongly out of nowhere. Roxy moved her free hand towards the unicorn’s body with experienced ease. 

“O’ spear of frost, impale! Icicle lance!”

And released from Roxy’s hand. The spear of ice released from an extremely short distance pierced through the unicorn’s heart with a tremendous force. 

“HiHiiiiiGahbh….”

Vomiting out blood, the unicorn’s body twitched for a moment and fell down with a crash.

“........”

Silence enveloped the place. The wind blew and trees swayed. The unicorn’s body continued to twitch slightly and dirtied the ground with the blood.

The fantastical scenery was long gone. The only thing left in this place is the whispers of greenery smelling of blood. If Rudeus is here, he would probably doubt whether he should look to Jesus and the heavens for a moment, then shed tears at Roxy’s gallantry, take a knee and give prayers to the god.

After sighing once, Roxy took out a rope and a knife from the bag and started draining the unicorn’s blood out.

“You did it! As expected of Roxy!”

Seeing that, Elinalise came out of the thickets, laughing with a face covered in glee. Roxy turned a motionless stare at Elinalise. 

“If we went on normally it would have attacked us normally, so wouldn’t it have been better to fight and take it down normally instead of going to all this trouble….”

“No, no, Roxy. Using maidens to hunt down unicorns like this is the way of people of the Great Forest from ancient times”

“And you say you don’t even want to visit your hometown….well that’s fine but help me with this. You both haven’t done anything at all”

Unicorn is a sacred animal. Be it the elves, or the dwarves, both say the same thing. But as long as a living thing lives it can’t escape from the shackles of the survival of the fittest.

And thus, a demonic beast called unicorn turned into blood, meat, and money for Roxy and the others.
