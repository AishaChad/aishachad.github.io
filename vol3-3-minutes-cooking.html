Ruijerd and Eris hunted a great king tortoise saying it’s for dinner. Its meat is judged to be the most delicious by the carnivore-filled Demon continent. And thus it’s a staple everywhere in the demon continent. 
But I find this meat terribly awful. It’s more stringy than chicken, smells strongly in a way that’s peculiar to wild animals, and while we are at it, it’s also hard on the stomach.
I exerted strenuous efforts day and night to make this meat palatable, . Let me show you the results of that hard work today. First, the ingredients.

<i>Ingredients
Meat from the great king tortoise
Vegetables for seasoning that are grown in the Demon continent
Fat from BigFootFish
All sorts of spices

Because the journey’s long, for the basic dish let’s use items that can be bought in any town. As for vegetables, they tend to differ from place to place so let’s buy whatever’s suitable. 
BigFootFish can be found in any watering hole across the Demon continent. It is a blowfish-looking amphibian with uncanny legs attached and not suitable for eating, being poisonous.
But the fat bag above the butt is just fine and is dealt in large volumes by the adventurers guild because it’s used in maintaining equipment.  It’s also sold in the town markets so buy it.
Well then, onwards to cooking the dish

<i>1. Cut the vegetables finely and fry them in BigFootFish’s fat</i>
 Vegetables are too bitter and harsh to eat when raw so stir-frying them is necessary. I have a feeling that by doing this you can get the bitterness out and increase the sweetness!

<i>2. Cut the great king tortoise meat into small pieces and smash it until it becomes pulpy. </i>
The tortoise’s meat is tough and stringy. So you have to grind the meat to even reduce it to a somewhat manageable level and bring out the softness.

<i>3. Mix the fried vegetables with the ground meat, season it and knead</i>
Season the vegetable stir fry made earlier with a good amount of spices. After doing that transfer it into a bowl or something and knead it into a paste.

<i>4. Beat it with your hand to get the air out</i>
Divide the stuff you got from step 3 into three mouth-sized pieces and beat the air out of them like you are trying to play catch. Because if you don’t get the air out it will crack while roasting and the meat juice will leak out.

<i>5. Get it into some good looking  shape and roast it by direct fire</i>
Things like frying pans and such don’t exist on this Demon continent. It’s also fine to make one, but because we have this netting-like thing let’s just use that. Roasting everything in a direct fire, that too a strong one is the manly way of cooking. It’s certainly not that it’s too much of a bother for me to do it any other way.
If the fire managed to reach the middle, then it’s done. Because sensible things like sauces don’t exist in the Demon continent, serve it directly.

“Tasty”
“It tastes pretty good, doesn’t it”

I am happy hearing these opinions from the people who would call anything tasty, but it’s probably better to not pay attention to them. These people would continue to call it tasty even if they eat it raw. They are different species compared to me with my delicate tongue. 
Well then, I should probably have a bite as well.
First, taking a bite, the flavor of BigFootFish’s fat spread through the whole mouth. The pungent taste hit me like industrial-grade alcohol, making me think I am going to faint for a moment. It’s so strong, to the extent that it’s hard to believe the words that it’s something edible.
When my teeth bit into it, juices flooded out from the inside. This juice still smells raw and tastes nothing like vegetables or spices.
The crunchy things I feel in my mouth are the vegetables. I can feel my face making a grimace this time, with some unspeakable cacophony of tastes spreading in my mouth. 
To sum it up, I just want to say one thing. This is disgusting!

The road to good food still stretches long.
